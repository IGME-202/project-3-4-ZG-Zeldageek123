Project Title: Project 4 - HvZ Pt. 2 - “Well... This is What I Got”
Description:
	Before I left for home from RIT for Thanksgiving (halfway through the week prior) the motherboard of my laptop, which was my only workspace, blew out and rendered my laptop unusable. Not having my own PC at home and still (as of even now!!!) waiting for my new computer, Prof. Baker gave me the option to pseudocode HvZ Part 2 at the very end of the semester for credit. I was, however, able to commit my project up to the point of implementing Obstacle Avoidance, so all I had to pseudocode was a method that find a future position, Pursue(), Evade(), uses of Pursue() and Evade(), Wander(), uses of Wander(), Separation(), and uses of Separation(). On this repo, I've committed a text file with all the pseudocode that was required.
